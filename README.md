# Home Service Robot
This project aims to develop the simulation environment and code based in ROS for a home service robot which has the following modules:
* Localization
* Mapping
* Path planning 
* Navigation

## Packages
### Oficial ROS packages 
* **gmapping**: With the gmapping_demo.launch file, you can easily perform SLAM and build a map of the environment with a robot equipped with laser range finder sensors or RGB-D cameras.
You can see documentation on:
http://wiki.ros.org/gmapping

* **turtlebot_teleop**: With the keyboard_teleop.launch file, you can manually control a robot using keyboard commands.
You can see documentation on: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_teleop

* **turtlebot_rviz_launchers**: With the view_navigation.launch file, you can load a preconfigured rviz workspace. Youâ€™ll save a lot of time by launching this file, because it will automatically load the robot model, trajectories, and map for you.
You can see documentation on: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_rviz_launchers

* **turtlebot_gazebo**: With the turtlebot_world.launch you can deploy a turtlebot in a gazebo environment by linking the world file to it. It also employs MCL algorthim, the particule filter, to localize the robot through amcl_demo.launch file.
You can see documentation on: http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_rviz_launchers

### Self-developed packages
* **add_markers**: With this module, you can simulate pick and drop of a mobile robot with markers. A green spheric marker will simulate the object. A red cubic marker the drop position. 

* **pick_objects**: This module communicates with the ROS navigation stack and send goals to the robot, the drop off goal and the pick up goal. The ROS navigation stack creates a path for yuor robot based on Dijkstra's algorithm, a variant of Uniform Cost Sear2ch to avoid obstacles on its path.

## Results
Going to the pick up goal.

Object has been picked up and now, leaving the goal.

Arriving to the drop off goal.

## Installation tips

When installing tutlrbot_gazebo you must install dependencies:
 
	rosdep -i install turtlebot_gazebo

After you should use command:
	
	catkin_make

To create a map you should install 
	sudo apt-get install libignition-math2-dev protobuf-compiler

Then, download pgm_map_creator to src folder:
	cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/src/
	git clone https://github.com/udacity/pgm_map_creator.git

Copy the Gazebo world you created to the world folder

	cp catkin_ws/src/worlds/u.world 

Insert the map creator to map fil. Open map file using editor. Add the following tag towards the end of the file, just before </world> tag
	<plugin filename="libcollision_map_creator.so" name="collision_map_creator"/>
